# devian

## Hi! 
This is my current porfolio 'Devian', coming from the word 'developer' and my name 'Ian'

## Beta Phase
Currently, the website is still underdevelopment so you might face bugs in there. Please send me a message if you found one.

## Development
Building from scratch I mainly used Vue and Sass together to make the development much efficient. I also used some third party libraries.

## Design 
The design of this portfolio is primarily inspired by <a href="https://olaolu.dev/">Olaolu Olawuyi</a> and blended some of my own ideas with it. 

## Future 
I will be adding more features in this porfolio sooner
